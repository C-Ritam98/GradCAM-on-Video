# GradCAM-on-Video
Second Project done as a part of the Advanced Deep Learning Course at IISc.

Explainability of Deep models is the new area of research. This project is the extension of the GradCAM idea proposed by Selvaraju et al. for giving explanation in image classification tasks. This project deals with finding explanation in video classification task performed by different model architectures.
